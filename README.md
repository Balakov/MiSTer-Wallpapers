# MiSTer-Wallpapers
Retro wallpapers specifically designed for the MiSTer FPGA project.

Currently available in 16:9 format in both processed and clean forms depending on your tastes. 

PNGs are for use on the MiSTer (rename to menu.png and copy to SD card), SVGs if you want to play about with them yourself in vector loveliness.

There are two variations of the ZX Spectrum version, but 10 images don't fit into a nice 3x3 preview!
